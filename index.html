                    <h4>Bride and Groom, Toronto</h4>
                    <p>We wish we could re-live that day again!!!!!! We have met our wedding photographer in advance in
                        order to
                        discuss the
                        concept and the ideas we had for the couple photoshoot. He did not hesitate when we asked him what
                        would
                        look best, and
                        appeared very knowledgeable. We couldn’t be happier with our pics!</p>

                    <h3>Gena & Michael</h3>
                    <h4>Bride and Groom</h4>
                    <p>We went with the Lucky Package for our small wedding. We only invited the closest family and friends,
                        and
                        we were
                        looking for photo+video coverage that would be discreet and that would do a good job capturing
                        everyone
                        and everything.
                        Our photo and video guys were professional and very friendly, which is something my guests
                        appreciated
                        because we are
                        usually camera-shy. So many amazing pictures, and the video is just sweet! Thank you!</p>
                </li>

                    <h4>Bride and Groom, Toronto</h4>
                    <p>Great guys! We only got a video package with them, because unfortunately by the time we found them we
                        already had a
                        photographer booked. I could see that the photographer always got in their way, and I can’t imagine
                        how
                        come their
                        videos are eventually so good, because I was sure all I’m gonna see is this guy and his camera. They
                        were so
                        professional about it, it really speaks volumes.</p>

                            <h3>WHY IS IT BETTER TO HIRE PHOTO AND VIDEO FROM ONE TEAM?</h3>
                            <p>Wedding photographers and videographers are performing the same job, and to do it well they need the
                                same
                                elements-
                                flattering angles, good lighting, right timing.When they work as a team, their working process
                                resembles
                                a dance where
                                each one knows how to move, so both of them get what they need. They focus on this flow instead of
                                competing with each
                                other for the best material, as it often happens when two strangers are hired, each to do his own
                                business.</p>

                            <h3>MAY I CUSTOMISE MY PHOTO AND VIDEO POST PRODUCTION?</h3>
                            <p>Most of our clients give us the full creative power over their wedding photos and videos and trust
                                that
                                we will use our
                                skills and knowledge to polish it to its maximum potential. However, sometimes clients request a
                                specific style of
                                colouring or a particular soundtrack for their videos, and that is fine with us.</p>

                            <h3>WILL MY PHOTOGRAPHS AND VIDEOS LOOK THE SAME?</h3>
                            <p>Yes, we colour grade our materials identically in order to maintain a uniform style. Most of our
                                clients
                                prefer natural
                                looking colour correction, with deep hues and timeless feel to it, so that is what we strive for

                                requested

                            <h3>HOW MANY PHOTOS CAN I EXPECT?</h3>
                            <p>We submit around 70-100 HQ edited photos per one hour of coverage. If it's a 10 hours coverage, you
                                get
                                around 1000
                                photos, but it also depends on how busy your wedding day is. If you have many ceremonies, rituals
                                and
                                performances, you
                                may expect this amount to double.</p>

                            <h3>WHAT ARE TURNAROUND TIMES?</h3>
                            <p>For photography, the turnaround is one month. We also send you around ten edited pictures within two
                                days
                                after the
                                wedding so you can share them with your relatives right away.
                                For the video, the deadline is three months from the moment the client has chosen a soundtrack. It
                                depends on the
                                season, but usually, we submit videos after roughly a month and a half.</p>

                            <h3>WHAT IS SO SPECIAL ABOUT YOUR SILENT COVERAGE?</h3>
                            <p>We use mirrorless cameras that don't have a clicking mechanism, so our photo cameras are silent. You
                                won't hear any
                                distracting noises during the ceremony or at any other time, as well as on your video.
                                Also, it means that our cameras can take more frames per second, ensuring that we capture every
                                moment.
