                    <h3>Melissa & Calvin</h3>
                    <h4>Bride and Groom, Toronto</h4>
                    <p>We wish we could re-live that day again!!!!!! We have met our wedding photographer in advance in
                        order to
                        discuss the
                        concept and the ideas we had for the couple photoshoot. He did not hesitate when we asked him what
                        would
                        look best, and
                        appeared very knowledgeable. We couldn’t be happier with our pics!</p>
                </li>

                    <h3>Gena & Michael</h3>
                    <h4>Bride and Groom</h4>
                    <p>We went with the Lucky Package for our small wedding. We only invited the closest family and friends,
                        and
                        we were
                        looking for photo+video coverage that would be discreet and that would do a good job capturing
                        everyone
                        and everything.
                        Our photo and video guys were professional and very friendly, which is something my guests
                        appreciated
                        because we are
                        usually camera-shy. So many amazing pictures, and the video is just sweet! Thank you!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Shira & Jin</h3>
                    <h4>Bride and Groom, Toronto</h4>
                    <p>Great guys! We only got a video package with them, because unfortunately by the time we found them we
                        already had a
                        photographer booked. I could see that the photographer always got in their way, and I can’t imagine
                        how
                        come their
                        videos are eventually so good, because I was sure all I’m gonna see is this guy and his camera. They
                        were so
                        professional about it, it really speaks volumes.</p>

            <h2 id="REVIEW">FAQ</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>WHY IS IT BETTER TO HIRE PHOTO AND VIDEO FROM ONE TEAM?</h3>
                    <p>Wedding photographers and videographers are performing the same job, and to do it well they need the
                        same
                        elements-
                        flattering angles, good lighting, right timing.When they work as a team, their working process
                        resembles
                        a dance where
                        each one knows how to move, so both of them get what they need. They focus on this flow instead of
                        competing with each
                        other for the best material, as it often happens when two strangers are hired, each to do his own
                        business.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>MAY I CUSTOMISE MY PHOTO AND VIDEO POST PRODUCTION?</h3>
                    <p>Most of our clients give us the full creative power over their wedding photos and videos and trust
                        that
                        we will use our
                        skills and knowledge to polish it to its maximum potential. However, sometimes clients request a
                        specific style of
                        colouring or a particular soundtrack for their videos, and that is fine with us.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>WILL MY PHOTOGRAPHS AND VIDEOS LOOK THE SAME?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, we colour grade our materials identically in order to maintain a uniform style. Most of our
                        clients
                        prefer natural
                        looking colour correction, with deep hues and timeless feel to it, so that is what we strive for
                        unless
                        requested
                        differently.</p>
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>HOW MANY PHOTOS CAN I EXPECT?</h3>
                    <p>We submit around 70-100 HQ edited photos per one hour of coverage. If it's a 10 hours coverage, you
                        get
                        around 1000
                        photos, but it also depends on how busy your wedding day is. If you have many ceremonies, rituals
                        and
                        performances, you
                        may expect this amount to double.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>WHAT ARE TURNAROUND TIMES?</h3>
                    <p>For photography, the turnaround is one month. We also send you around ten edited pictures within two
                        days
                        after the
                        wedding so you can share them with your relatives right away.
                        For the video, the deadline is three months from the moment the client has chosen a soundtrack. It
                        depends on the
                        season, but usually, we submit videos after roughly a month and a half.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>WHAT IS SO SPECIAL ABOUT YOUR SILENT COVERAGE?</h3>
                    <p>We use mirrorless cameras that don't have a clicking mechanism, so our photo cameras are silent. You
                        won't hear any
                        distracting noises during the ceremony or at any other time, as well as on your video.
                        Also, it means that our cameras can take more frames per second, ensuring that we capture every
                        moment.

                        families’
                        legacies and
                        bring their own traditions and rituals into their weddings. Since Toronto is a very multi-cultural
                        city,
                        we believe it
                        is very important to highlight our expertease in covering Chinese, Korean, Sikh, and other weddings

                        something very adventurous about getting married in a foreign country, it calls for professional
                        coverage that utilizes
                        the unusual locations.</p>
